Functional Python

This repository contains exercises to learn functional programming in Python.

Functional programming is often associated with specific programming languages.
However, FP is more a way of thinking, a paradigm. A functional programming
style can be applied to almost all programming languages.

This repository focuses on Python. Python is not a purely functional language,
but it has many features that make it possible to program in a practical
functional style.

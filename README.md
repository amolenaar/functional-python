# Functional Python

This repository contains exercises to learn functional programming in Python.

Functional programming is often associated with specific programming languages.
However, FP is more a way of thinking, a paradigm. A functional programming
style can be applied to almost all programming languages.

This repository focuses on Python. Python is not a purely functional language,
but it has many features that make it possible to program in a practical
functional style.


## Rectangles

The file `rectangles/rectangles.py` contains a simple rectangle implementation. Implement the `TODO`'s.


## Shapes

The folders `shape-fp` and `shape-oo` both contain code with similar functionality: you can calculate the area of a circle and a square.

To both implementations:

* Add a third shape, a [Right Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_triangle).
* Calculate circumference for the shapes
